#Day One Dev Notes
I started after 2 and worked until about 5. This is what I called "Setup time" and didn't add it to the total time tracking.

I got NPM setup on my machine, set up the enviornment, got the boilerplate HTML/JS installed, installed the packages that I wanted to use, listed below, and got some initial buttons to swap between the views.
To be honest, I just decided to put it all in the index.html to save time, and just having different div displays for the admin view and the customer view
Installed Jest(I haven't used this yet, so I suspect it'll be slow going but hey, I'd like to learn it!), jQuery, and Bootstrap. These two libraries are working together to really make it look reasonable and to make it easy to build out the UI.

From about 9:00 to 11 I did a bulk of the work on the admin view. I will say there was several little breaks taken to investigate alternate design options. I'd put my total effort at about 1.5 hours
I got an account generation div that adds the account based on the input
Inside that accordion there is an "Add Advertisement" button to bring up the modal, as well as an edit div. These are ugly but working for now. If given more time I'd polish these to make them look good
The modal has all the input needed for your ads listed in the spec
creating the ad displays a preview

Todo for tomorrow: 
get unit testing implemented(This should have been done earlier, I just got carried away in the design stuff)
get the customer view implemented
fix token generation
allow the ad to be deleted
Get this hooked into the example backend
